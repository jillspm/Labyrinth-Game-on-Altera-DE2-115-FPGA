The popularity of Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) technology is growing among designers specializing in Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC). FPGAs are favoured for their ease of development and maintenance, making them an attractive choice for applications where speed and efficiency are crucial. This project focuses on exploring the capabilities of FPGAs by developing a simple labyrinth game with a VGA display. The entire implementation was carried out on a DE2-115 development board, utilizing the VHDL hardware description language. For the implementation of the game the most important task is its VHDL programming. Labyrinth game is typically a classic pong game in a closed maze. It is a two-player game, where each player tries to thit a ball towards the opponent using paddles. Also, several fundamental functionalities, including enhancing the ball's speed, generating sound, and displaying textual information, have been incorporated. Game controlling was implemented through four keys in a PS-2 keyboard and the resolution of the monitor also must be set at 640 x 480 to meet the requirement.
